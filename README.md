## Front-End Engineering Challenge
Build an application that dynamically generates form inputs from a provided JSON configuration
and autosaves them to a backing store using the browserâ€™s LocalStorage.

## Implementation Details

This type of configuration would typically come from an API, but you may load it from a JSON
file or hardcode them for this project. You can assume this configuration does not change during
the lifecycle of your application. You are responsible for creating the input components as you
see fit for the best user experience. Feel free to use any libraries that may help you with
implementation as you would in a production codebase.
The input configuration is defined as:

```
[
  {
    entity: 'Loan', // 'Loan' | 'Borrower'
    display: 'Loan Amount',
    field: 'loanAmount',
    type: 'money', // 'string' | 'money' | 'date'
    conditions: { maxValue: 100000000, minValue: 1000 } // conditions schema valid if type == money
  },
  {
    entity: 'Borrower', // 'Loan' | 'Borrower'
    display: 'First Name',
    field: 'firstName',
    type: 'string', // 'string' | 'money' | 'date'
    conditions: { regex: '^[a-zA-Z]+$' } // conditions schema valid if type == string
  },
  ...
  ...
]
```

_Entity_ is always either a Loan or a Borrower.
_Display_ represents the human-friendly label for the field.
_Field_ is a string that uniquely identifies an input on an Entity. (Entity, Field) will always be unique.
_Type_ is always either string, money, or date.

- A **string** is any valid javascript string. Empty saved string inputs should store an empty
string.
- A **money** is any valid javascript number. Empty saved money inputs should store null.
- A **date** is an object with the following schema. Empty saved date inputs should store
null.

_Conditions_ will vary depending on the type and will trigger validation errors.
- If the type is **money**, valid conditions are maxValue and minValue. (see sample input)
- If the type is **string**, a regex can be provided for validation. (see sample input)
- If the type is **date**, there are no validation conditions.

Each of these input fields will run validation and autosave on **blur**. Validation errors should
block the saving of the field to the backing store. Typically, the save event will trigger an API
call, but for this project you should persist the information to the browser LocalStorage.

The backing store should be formatted as follows:

```
{
  Loan: {
    loanAmount: 500000,
    loanType: 'Purchase',
    downPaymentAmount: 100000
  },
  Borrower: {
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Homeowner',
    birthDate: {
      month: 1, // 1-12
      day: 14, // 1-31
      year: 1988
    }
  }
}
```

The top-level Loan and Borrower objects can optionally exist if they do not contain any saved
fields. When an input field is saved, a value with the key of field should be added to the
corresponding entity object.

**Whenever an input field is successfully saved, please log the contents of the entire
backing store to the console.**

**The application should reload any information from the backing store whenever the page
is reloaded, even if the server is restarted.**

## User Interface

You may design the UI however you prefer with attention to usability. A sample user interface
may look like this, but this is just an example.

You will find that you will have to make some UX decisions around edge cases. For example,
when an input validator fails, how does the user recover from that, and what is the impact on the
backing store?
It is up to you to decide how you want to handle these scenarios, and you may be asked to
justify your decisions.

## Description

This project is powered by Create React App

### Start the app in dev mode

```
npm run start
```

### Start storybook

```
npm run storybook # this will host storybook on http://localhost:6006
```

### Run test

```
npm run test
```

### Validation

If blurred input failed to validate, local storage won't be updated

If blurred input passed validation and another field is invalid, local storage will be merged with only validated values
